# Payment Processing Demo Application

## Overview
This Java application demonstrates a payment processing system that handles different types of payment methods using the 3-layer architecture, Dependency Injection (DI), and follows the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).

## Supported Payment Methods
- **Credit/Debit Card**: Process payments using card information
- **E-Wallet**: Process payments through digital wallet providers (PayPal, etc.)
- **Bank Transfer**: Process payments via direct bank transfers

## Architecture

### 3-Layer Architecture Implementation

#### 1. Presentation Layer (`PaymentDemo.java`)
- **Responsibility**: Entry point and user interaction
- **Functions**:
  - Instantiates desired payment methods
  - Injects payment methods into the service layer
  - Calls business logic
  - Demonstrates different payment scenarios

#### 2. Service Layer (`PaymentService.java`)
- **Responsibility**: Business logic and payment orchestration
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: This class has ONE responsibility - to process payments using the injected payment method. It handles validation, logging, fee calculation, and transaction management without knowing the specific implementation details of how payments are processed.
- **Functions**:
  - Payment validation (amount limits, positive values)
  - Transaction fee calculation
  - Payment processing orchestration
  - Logging and transaction management

#### 3. Data Layer (`PaymentMethod` interface and implementations)
- **Responsibility**: Data access and payment method implementations
- **Components**:
  - `PaymentMethod` interface: Defines the contract
  - `CardPayment`: Credit/Debit card implementation
  - `EwalletPayment`: E-wallet implementation
  - `BankTransferPayment`: Bank transfer implementation

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Dependency Injection (DI)
- Constructor injection in `PaymentService`
- Loose coupling between layers
- Easy testing and maintenance

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- System is open for extension (new payment methods can be added)
- System is closed for modification (existing code doesn't need changes)
- New payment types can be added by implementing `PaymentMethod` interface

### 3. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has one clear responsibility
- `PaymentService` only handles payment processing logic
- Payment method classes only handle their specific payment processing

## How to Run
```bash
# Compile the project
mvn compile

# Run the demo
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="vn.edu.eiu.lab4.PaymentDemo"
```

## Analysis: Is the Layered Design Reasonable?

### Current Design Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
2. **Dependency Injection**: Promotes loose coupling and testability
3. **Open-Closed Principle**: Easy to extend with new payment methods
4. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose

**Areas for Improvement:**

### Recommended Revisions

#### 1. **Repository Pattern for Data Layer**
The current design mixes data access with business entities. A better approach would be:

```
Data Layer Structure:
├── entities/
│   ├── PaymentMethod.java (interface)
│   ├── CardPayment.java
│   ├── EwalletPayment.java
│   └── BankTransferPayment.java
├── repositories/
│   ├── PaymentRepository.java (interface)
│   └── PaymentRepositoryImpl.java
└── dto/
    └── PaymentRequest.java
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Service Layer**
Add more business logic separation:

```
Service Layer Structure:
├── PaymentService.java (main service)
├── ValidationService.java (validation logic)
├── FeeCalculationService.java (fee calculation)
└── TransactionLogService.java (logging)
```

#### 3. **Improved Presentation Layer**
Add proper controllers and DTOs:

```
Presentation Layer Structure:
├── controllers/
│   └── PaymentController.java
├── dto/
│   ├── PaymentRequest.java
│   └── PaymentResponse.java
└── PaymentDemo.java (main class)
```

#### 4. **Configuration Layer**
Add a configuration layer for better dependency management:

```
Configuration Structure:
├── config/
│   ├── PaymentConfig.java
│   └── ApplicationConfig.java
```

### Conclusion

The current layered design is **reasonable for a basic demonstration** but could be improved for production use. The main improvements would be:

1. **Separate data entities from data access logic**
2. **Add proper repository pattern for data persistence**
3. **Enhance service layer with more granular services**
4. **Add configuration management**
5. **Implement proper error handling and logging**
6. **Add unit tests for each layer**

The current design successfully demonstrates the core principles (DI, OCP, SRP) but would benefit from more sophisticated patterns for real-world applications.
